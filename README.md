# Ashta-Chamma 

## Description: 
An Indian version of the popular game Ludo. 

See [Ashta-Chamma](https://wiki2.org/en/Ashta_Chamma_(board_game)) to know more

The game has been build by using **pygame** module in **python3** üêç 

##Game Rules:

1. When game starts all pawns are blocked at home, to release pawns player must roll 1 or 4 or 8.

2. Every player has a path to reach destination . So when player gets a number, then he/she needs to choose one of their released pawns and move it that many squares along the path.

3. Only one pawn can stand on a square except on a safe square which marked with star. So if player 1‚Äôs pawn stands on a square and player 2‚Äôs pawn is moving to the same square then player 2 pawn can kill Player 1‚Äôs pawn. Then player 1‚Äôs pawn will go back to the starting square and gets blocked again.

4. When player rolls 4, 8 or kills opponent pawn he/she will get another chance to roll.

5. Reaching the central square: A pawn needs to reach the central square exactly. For example, if a pawn is 3 squares away from the center and the player throws a 4, then that pawn cannot be moved.
